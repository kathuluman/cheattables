============================ HOW TO USE THIS CHEAT TABLE ============================
Info =======
There are a few things that are a work in progress here such as the casino cheats which I am still working on. 
This is my first cheat table that I recently started developing around 3 days ago for GTAV.
With this cheat table you will have the ability to have some good cheats which could make doing hiests 
or missions easier wich as infinate ammo, no reload, and much more.

UPDATE JUL 17 2024 +++++++++++++++++++++
1.) Added better UI Aesthetic a compact view so you can focus on your cheat table and nothing more.
2.) Fixed some bugged code that would allow NPC's to have God Mode.
3.) Added Wanted Level Editor
4.) Added No wanted level cheat to have no wanted level
4.) Changed Font type to (Italic bold sans)

HOW TO USE *****************************
          GOD MODE
When using god mode there is a drop down menu which if you doubble click under the Value column there 
is an option select it and make sure it is enabled.


        WANTED LEVEL

In order to use wanted level modification first you will need to enable "Enable Modifications".
This will find the addresses associated with wanted level, under wanted stars doubble click under the 
Value column and there is a drop down where you can edit your wanted level from 0-5.

As for No wanted level it is the same principal enable it and go to the drop down and click the Enable
drop down option.
